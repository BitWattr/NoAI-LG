#🚀 NoAI LG - No AI Language Generalizer
##🌟 Overview
 NoAI LG is an ambitious project aimed at generating meaningful sentences without relying on neural networks! 🤯 Instead of deep learning, we use pattern-based techniques to understand and transform language.

##🛠 What We’ve Built
 ✅ Language Translator - Our current implementation takes an input sentence and generates a similar sentence as output! (Try it out with infer.py)

##🔍 How It Works
 ###✂️ Tokenizer
  Instead of breaking text into individual words, our custom tokenizer detects and tokenizes common phrases for better context understanding.
 
 ###🔄 Translation Mechanism
  1️⃣ Similarity Matrix 📊 - We analyze a dataset of sentences to build a matrix that determines how similar each token is to every other token in the vocabulary.
  2️⃣ Inference (Translation) 🤖 - Using this pattern-based similarity matrix, tokens are replaced with similar ones to create a new sentence.

 ##🔮 Future Possibilities
  💡 Question Answering – Answer queries without AI models
  📝 Language Generation – Create meaningful text using patterns
  📚 Summarization – Extract key points from long texts

🌟 Stay tuned for more updates! 🚀
